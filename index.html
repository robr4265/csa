Some time ago, I read in The New York Times about child abuse in the Catholic Church in France. The article mentioned that the estimate of abused children was over 200,000 from 1950 to 2020. I was intrigued by how the researchers got to this horrifically large number and thought that this was a case where Data Science was used for the betterment of humanity by exposing statistical information that irrefutably pointed to institutional and systematic actions that hurt the ones the Church is supposed to protect.

For this project, we are using data from Child Sexual Abuse in the Roman Catholic Church in France: Prevalence and Comparison With Other Social Spheres, which describes data obtained from a web-based survey of 28,026 adults in 2021. The findings from this data were later used to estimate the 200,000 figure in the later Sexual Violence in the Catholic Church France 1950 – 2020 Final Report.

### Key attributes/dimensions of the data

I will use data from a survey aimed at estimating and comparing Roman Catholic Church-related child sexual abuse (CSA). The survey has answers from 28,026 adults in 2021 France and the key attributes of the data are:
- CSA on Men and Women
- CSA by age
- Year of the first abuse
- Duration of abuse
- Perpetrators sex
- Perpetrators age
- Social Sphere (Family, Church, Public School)

### Goals for working with the data

The goal of working with this data is to illustrate some of the characteristics of massive abuse that the Catholic Church perpetrated on kids. 

### Existing relevant visualization for working with that data
Some existing relevant visualizations are Bar Charts with Error Bars, which can be improved by adding dimensions like the father’s occupation and the victim's age.

### Existing visualization critique
A critique of existing visualizations is that instead of using Bar Charts with Errors, they could have used Violin Charts to demonstrate the shape of the distribution.
